Authentication
Process 1
•	hash the password and username creating a unique value for each user.
•	then send that hash to every other user on the network.
•	the other users will check if hash is in their dictionary of valid hashes.
•	if a majority agree then you have been validated.
Cons
•	insecure as each user must have a list of valid hashes, which they could just use one of
•	also, may get false negatives due to hashes not being synced network wide.
•	a small network is easily overwhelmed as by hacked clients faking valid or invalid responses either locking all accounts out or allowing easy access by bad actors.
Pros
•	Easy.
Process 2
•	encrypt the user name with the password using RSA.
•	all clients on network know private key for the encryption.
•	send encrypted username and username to all clients on network.
•	the clients then attempt to unencrypt encrypted username if that equals the username then they validate the login.
•	if majority of clients validate login - login continues.
Cons
•	possible that as the client would have access to list of unencrypts they could find a username value and an encrypted value that would decrypt with one of the unencrypts.
•	the username and encrypted username could be packed sniffed then used.
Pros
•	more secure than process one.
•	password remains hidden from all users.
•	a small network is easily overwhelmed as by hacked clients faking valid or invalid responses either locking all accounts out or allowing easy access by bad actors.
Process 3
•	send username to all users on network if that users unencrypt or is not in local database.
•	users on network return the unencrypter for that user encrypted with a key unknown to everyone.
•	3. local client the attempts to unencrypt unencrypter or with password.
•	4. local client then unencrypts the user data with unencrypted unencryptor.
Cons
•	could attempt to brute force unencrypter unencrypting as they would be downloaded onto every user device.
•	would require long calculation at account creation to mitigate threat of brute forcing.
Pros
•	more secure than Process 1 and 2.
•	does not require network access.
